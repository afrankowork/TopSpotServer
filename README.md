# TopSpotServer

Top Spots answers the question of 'Whats for dinner tonight?' My friends and I are constantly debating where to go eat and struggle to agree. This site is designed to help solve that
problem by showing users top restaurants in their area and allowing them to search by name. The client was built with React, Typescript, and Reactstrap. The server
was built with Node/JS, Express and Firestore. We store our users, comments, and location list with an express app, while the chat is maintained with firestore
